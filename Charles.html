<h3>Ref: Albert Momo University Application</h3><hr>

<p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent applicationto to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year.I will answer all your question one by one,in the following sections.</p>
 <h5>Starting dates </h5>
 
 <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you would start at the beginning of the semester;the start dates for each one are as follow:</p>
<p>First semester: 9 October 2022
<br>Second semester:15 January 2023
<br>Third semester: 2 May 2023</p>

<p>Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

<p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>

<h5> Subject of Study</h5>

<p>At Starz University,we have a pretty open-minded research facility_as long as the subject fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an intelligen,dadicated researcher and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that if the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as,in other of priority: </p>
<p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3.)</sub>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players as temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F),when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3<symbol>×</symbol> 10<sup>3</sup>increasing 3<symbol>×</symbol>10<sup>4</sup>.)</p>

<p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>

<p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd 
expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd 
need to know? Thanks.
</p>

<h5>Exotic dance moves</h5>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To 
answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

Polynesian chicken dance

<blockquote>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village 

would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</blockquote>
Icelandic brownian shuffle
<blockquote>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice 
this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling 
their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow 
students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</blockquote>
Arctic robot dance
<blockquote>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s 
believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted 
movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on 
however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really 
cold.</blockquote>

<p> Yours sincerely,</p><br>
